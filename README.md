**Penit** is a modern Note Taking App. 
It aims to ensure easy and quick note taking. This app allows you to create , store , edit and delete different types of notes.

The art of note taking is a common habit among the world’s most successful people.
Taking notes can help you to organize your thoughts and record vital information in every area of your business and life.

Think about it:
Are you really going to remember everything? Wouldn’t it be more beneficial to simply write down what you’re hearing, learning and thinking?

The habit of note taking can be developed and has a huge upside.

Now the ways in which people take notes may differ, some people may be confortable with typing text notes, some may take notes by sketchnoting while some may be prefer voice memos.

This app is a solution for all.

## Features :
* It allows you take notes in a digital way by typing regular text.

* It can also save voice memos which save up time drastically

* It also has a sketchnoting feature wherein you can 'draw' your notes.
